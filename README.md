## 📖 About

This project demonstrates a full-stack machine learning workflow:

- **Dataset Handling** – Preprocessing and organizing car images for classification.
- **Model Training** – Building and training a CNN-based deep learning model.
- **Model Serving** – Deploying the model with FastAPI for real-time predictions.
- **Reproducibility** – Code and environment setup for replicating the results.

Each step of the project is documented for clarity and future reference.

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone this repo and set up your environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shash-vat/Deep-Learning-Projects-.git
cd Deep-Learning-Projects-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Start the FastAPI server:
uvicorn FastAPI_Server.main:app --reload
Open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to test the API.

## 🤖 Model
The pre-trained model (saved_model.pth) is included in this repository for convenience.
For larger deployments, consider hosting models on:
- Hugging Face Hub
- AWS S3
- Google Drive

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integrate a frontend UI for easier image uploads
- Experiment with advanced architectures (EfficientNet, ResNet)
- Add more labeled datasets for better generalization
